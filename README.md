# ChatWiser

ChatWiser is a modern, smart, and secure chat application built with Angular. It provides a seamless way to connect with people anytime, anywhere.

## Features

- Real-time chat interface (UI placeholder currently)
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Easy to extend and customize with Angular CLI

## Development Server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code Scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building the Project

To build the project, run:

```bash
ng build
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. The production build optimizes the app for best performance.

## Running Unit Tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running End-to-End Tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Note: Angular CLI does not include an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
